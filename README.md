(FAQS)

which DMA card should I get? : If you want to save money, 35T. If you don't mind spending more for a faster and new DMA card, I suggest the 75T.

What Firmware do I need for my DMA card? : 35T - Squirrel, 75T - EnigmaX1.

If I have a 35T, and I buy a new card E.g(cap DMA 4th Gen), is it fine to flash the same FW? : Yes, both 35T and 4th gen cap DMA share the same prototype chip (squirrel).

What are the minimum specs I need for my second computer? : USB 3.0, at least 6GB RAM,

Why do I get Tiny PCIe TLP Algorithm when running a speed test? : This happens due to the motherboard in the main PC not liking the config space of the DMA FW.

How do I flash my FW? : If you are using 35T, use Open OCD to program and to upgrade or visit How to Flash

What donor board do I need? : Any PCIe Device technically can be used as a donor board. I wouldn't recommend using the values from an already existing PCIe Device you have on your computer. E.g. (GPU). I use an Intel Wifi 6 Ax200 card. You don't need to use this, you can use devices such as video capture cards, USB extensions, Sound Cards, SATA Expansion Cards, and so on.

What is Firmware Locking : Firmware locking refers to the process of securing the firmware on a device to prevent unauthorized access, modification, or copying

How does Firmware Locking Work? : Firmware locking works by getting the EFUSE FUSER_DNA value of the Artix7 chip from your DMA card and running a check on system bootup to check if a hard-coded(yourDNA) value is the same as your Artix7 DNA. If the DNA values match, the firmware will work, otherwise, the firmware won't work. This is intended to work for 1 person, and 1 person only since Artix7 chips have their own Unique Identifier(DNA).
